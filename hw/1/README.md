1. [Here is the README file I created](../../README.md)   
2. Local, Centralized, and Distrbuted.  
3. Distributed is the best because with this, each client has a copy of the central database at their local storage device. Every clone of the central repository with each client is a full backup of the projectâ€™s data and history. If the central server/repository fails for any reason, the local repository of the team member that has the most recent clone of the project database can be used to restore the central repository.
4. a. git pull: Pull the latest project revision from the remote to the local repository.  
b. git status: Check the status of the project.  
c. git add --all: Add files to the staging area.  
d. git commit -m"latest build": Commit the staged files to the local repository.  
e. git push --all:  Push the changes in the local repository to the remote repository.
