1. The 3 pillars are experiment, theory and computational.
2. The three different applications of Computational and Data Sciences are 1. predictive computing- a workflow bridging data, hypothesis/theory, and prediction, 2. numerical simulation- . a substitute for experiment and observational data, where it is not available, 3. data-driven discovery via machine learning, deep learning- a substitute for theory, where it is not available.  
3. The two types of scientific reasoning are deductive and plausible. A deductive reasoning argument example is if A is true, then B is true and if B is false, therefore A is false. A plausible reasoning example is if A=  it will start to rain by 10 am at the latest; B â‰¡ the sky will become cloudy before 10 am.  
4. An example can be the 2 statements in number 3 shows logical implication, like since its rainy, there will be clouds. 
5. 5. If the window of a jewelry store is broken and the alarm is ringing and a masked man with a bag full of jewelry is crawling out spotted by the cop is true, then the masked man is dishonest.
