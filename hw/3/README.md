1. The 3 pillars are experiment, theory and computational.  
2. The three different applications of Computational and Data Sciences are 1. predictive computing- a workflow bridging data, hypothesis/theory, and prediction, 2. numerical simulation- . a substitute for experiment and observational data, where it is not available, 3. data-driven discovery via machine learning, deep learning- a substitute for theory, where it is not available.  
3. The two types of scientific reasoning are deductive and plausible. A deductive reasoning argument example is if A is true, then B is true and if B is false, therefore A is false. A plausible reasoning example is if A=  it will start to rain by 10 am at the latest; B â‰¡ the sky will become cloudy before 10 am.  
4. An example can be the 2 statements in number 3 shows logical implication, like since its rainy, there will be clouds.  
5. 5. If the window of a jewelry store is broken and the alarm is ringing and a masked man with a bag full of jewelry is crawling out spotted by the cop is true, then the masked man is dishonest.  
6. This pdf shpws venn diagrams of logical implications.  
7. This pdf shows the venn diagrams of logical product of denial  
8. The pdf shows the table of logical functions with 1 input, (FOR F1A AND F2A THEY SWITCHED PLACES BUT THE ANSWER IS CORRECT).  
9. The pdf shows the table of logical functions with 2 inputs  
10.  The pdf shows the table of logical functions in terms of logic functions  
11.  The pdf shows the table of fundamental logicical operators  
12. a) The smallest unit of info in a computer is a bit.  
    b) A bit is the smallest unit of info in a computer, therefore the smallest unit of information is stored and processed by a bit.
