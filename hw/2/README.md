1. This contains the pdfs  
1 a. Fortran, lisp, Algol 58, Basic, C, sh, C++, Fortran 90, Java, Python, Java, JavaScript, C#  
1 b. 1954- Fortran, 1958- Lisp, 1964- Basic, 1971- C & Sh, 1983- C++, 1991- Fortran, Java, Python, 1995- Javascript, 2000- C#

2.  ENIAC stands for Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer.
3.  Integers store values and run loops.
4.  Cache memory is the fastest part of the computer memory.  
5.  The disk is the slowest storage device in computers.  
6.  A bit is the smallest unit of info in computer science.  
7. A) Assembly is the closest programming language to machine code.
7. B) No, assemblys don't need interpretors because machines can run them directly.  
8. A) Fortran is the oldest high level programming language
8. B) 1954- 1991, , about 15 yrs+ years or 3-4 decades.  
9. A) Assembly is a second gen programming language.  
9. B) Fortran, C, and C++ are 3rd gen and Python, R, and Matlab are 4th gen.  
10. C - 1971, 1983- C++, Python- 1991  
11. BCPL and B are ancestor programming languages of C.  
12. C with classes is a programming language of C++ and C is an ancestor of C with classes.
13. MATLAB's programming language ancestor is Fortran and Python's programming language ancestor is ABC.
14. Registers are the fastest part of the memory in the memory hiearchy of modern computers.
15. The smallest memory unit in the memory hierarchy of modern computers is the cache.  
16. The register is faster than the RAM by 100 ns faster.  
17. The RAM is faster than the SSD hard drives by one to two orders of magnitude because RAM is 10-100 GB and SSD is 50 MB - 200 MB. 
18. The RAM is faster than the HDD hard drive by 100,000.  
19. Transistors act like a switch to allow the flow of current.
20. We cannot add more transistors to computers to make them faster is because that means transistors had to be smaller and cant function properly, also the amount of heat they produce at fast speeds.
21. The 3 stages of the CPU cycle are 1) the instruction fetch stage, 2) decode stage, 3) execution stage. The repetition of the 3 tasks is an instruction cycle/ cpu cycle.
22. A powerful computer with more cpu cycles can be slower than a compuer with less cpu cycles because the cpu provides the instructions and processing power it depends on the clock speed.  
23. The bottleneck of speed in mondern computers is the memory access due to the technological progress in development of smaller transistors.
24. Dennard scaling is reducing energy consumption by having transistors smaller, that the more transistors we cab fit on the IC, the faster the CPU will be. MOSFET scaling is another name for Dennard Scaling. Moore's law is that the number of transisotrs in the IC will double every 2 years.
25. 1. on the 64th square, there will need to be put 65 grains of rice.    
    2. Overalll, there will be 2080 grains of rice to fill all the chessboard squares.
    3. 2080 grains/ 7000 grains = 0.297 lbs of rice to fill up the square.
26. 1. On the 64th square there will be 9,223,372,036,854,775,808 grains of rice needed.
    2. You would need 20,000,000,000,000,000,000 grains to fill up the last chessboard geometrically.
    3. You would need 2.8 x 10^15 for this task.
    4. It would take about 1400 years.
