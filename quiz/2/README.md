1. The fastest component of a computer memory is the cache/ register  
2. To address the speed gap between CPU and memory
3. The disk
4. Register, L1 cache, L2 cache, L3 cache, DRAM/RAM, Disk.  
5. A bit is the smallest unit of info
6. Because they are a set of instructions for machine code or language for input data or value. 
  
7. Register's speeds can go to less than ns and KB.
8. 1943 was when the first digital computer was built.  
9. 1945 was when the first purpose digital computer was created.  
10. A fixed program computer is a computer that can only perform algorithms for which they had been physically wired and built.
11. An example of a modern day fixed program computer would be a calculator or an atm.
12. Declarative knowledge is statements of fact and imperative knowledge is how to accomplish something, basically an algorithm.
13. 1. Declarative
    2. Declarative
    3. Imperative
    4. Imperative
    5. Declarative?
14. Human knowledge algorithms belong to the class of Imperative.
15. ENIAC is the first digital computer.
16. A computer programming langauge for bioinformatics would be Python
17. Fortran would be with NC, Atmospheric, Plasma, and Aerospace  
18. The 5 major components of a modern digital computer are Motherboard, Central Processing Unit (CPU), Graphical Processing Unit (GPU), Random Access Memory (RAM), and a storage device.  
19. ENIAC is a fixed program computer
20. Fortran, Cobol, B, C++, Java, Python
22. 1. The closest human readble programming to machine code is Assembly.
    2. It does not need interpretation.
23. 1. Fortran is the oldest high level programming language.
    2. +15 years, 3-4 decades, 1954-1991
24. 1. Assembly is a second gen  
    2. Fortran, C, and C++ are 3rd gen and Python, R, and Matlab are 4th gen.  
25.  BPCL and B are ancestors to C
26.  C with CLasses is an ancestor to C++
27.  MATLAB's programming language ancestor is Fortran and Python's programming language ancestor is ABC.
28. A logarithm displays exponential growth.
29. (33/2) * (3+99) = 1683  
30. HDD, 5 years
31. A clock or a typewriter. 
32. 10^5050, I did it all by hand and also did (100/2) * (1+100) and subsituted that for the power.
