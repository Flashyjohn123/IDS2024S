1. .md means main directory and we use .md extensions so that the README file is read and we can code and edit it. 
2. Yes, you will have a hidden .git folder in the directory, and if it doesn't exist, git will first atuomatically create and initaliaze an empty project inside it.  
3. Yes, every GIT project has a .git folder  
4. The .git folder will contain all of the histories of the new project  
5. The linux bash command cd changes to home directory.
6. The Linux Bash command ls -a will display a list of all files and folders in the home directory of the computer.
7. The Linux Bash command pwd shows the current directory.
8. The three different areas in a GIT Project are: Working directory, Staging area, and Repository. The working directory is where project files can be modified and GIT cannot track changes nor recover files if lost or removed. The staging area is where files modified can be later committed permanenmently to the repository that stores information about what will go into the next commit to the repository; this is known as the index. The Repository or .git directory is a permanent part of the staged filed and they can be extracted for review or further development.
9. A VCS is a software that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that specific versions can be recalled later.
10. 6 major benefits for using distributed VCS for project indexing and maintenance is Reduces data redundacy and storage inefficiency, Prevents high risk of errors and irreversible mistakes, reduces difficulty in tracking minor developments in the project, reduces ambiguity in version differences, can share and collab easier, and no risk of complete data loss.
11.  The three major historical classes of VCS are: Local, Centralized, and Distributed.
12.  So Git is a DVCS software as Github is an internet hosting service that works exclusively for projects that are indexed using Git.
13.  Git status checks the status of the project.
14.  Git push -all pushes the commit from the local repository to the remote repository to place them there permanently and share with others.
15.  Git pull pulls the latest project revision from the remote to the local.
16.  Markdown is a way to style text on the web.
17.  To make a text bold you can do ** or __ in front and behind the piece of text you want bolded.
18.  To make a text italic, you can do * or _ in front and behind the text you want italicized.
19.  Git init will initalize an empty git project in local system.
20.  . and .. in directory path names mean that it will put the folder in the previous folder, basically jumping folders.
21.  mkdir testdir
