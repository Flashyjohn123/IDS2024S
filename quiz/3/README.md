1. Observe the data, model construction and calabritation and validation, prediction.
2. experiment, theory and computational
3. The three different applications of Computational and Data Sciences are 1. predictive computing- a workflow bridging data, hypothesis/theory, and prediction, 2. numerical simulation- . a substitute for experiment and observational data, where it is not available, 3. data-driven discovery via machine learning, deep learning- a substitute for theory, where it is not available.
4. The two types of scientific reasoning are deductive and plausible. A deductive reasoning argument example is if A is true, then B is true and if B is false, therefore A is false. A plausible reasoning example is if A= it will start to rain by 10 am at the latest; B ≡ the sky will become cloudy before 10 am.
5. No, because the premise ‘if A then B’ expresses B only as a
logical consequence of A; and not necessarily a causal physical consequence, which could
be effective only later. For example: An example can be the 2 statements in number 3 shows logical implication, like since its rainy, there will be clouds. Or for another example, If A is true, then B becomes more plausible, B is true, therefore, A becomes more plausible.
6. Boolean algebra is named after George Boole.

18. I dont think this wasnt a fair quiz, as some of the concepts we went over had little context somtimes and definitions were hard to remember. The pace for the concepts were a bit fast to grasp. The past quizzes seemed fine, I just wish there was more proper explaination to some concepts.
